# 👋 Hi, I’m Fabián Carrillo

## 🚀 Sr. Automation Delivery Manager | AWS | Data | Generative AI

I lead the **delivery of complex, enterprise-scale initiatives** across AWS-based data platforms and Generative AI solutions, with a strong focus on **governance, architecture-first execution, and predictable outcomes**.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- 🧠 **Artificial Intelligence & Agentic Systems**
- ☁️ **AWS Cloud Architecture**
- 📊 **Data Platforms (DWH, Data Lakes, Streaming)**
- 📦 **Agile Delivery & Program Management**

## 🏢 What I Do

- Lead **multi-quarter, multi-vendor delivery programs**
- Translate business initiatives into **governed technical execution**
- Define and enforce **delivery standards using GitHub**
- Drive **architecture-led development** for AI and data platforms
- Ensure **traceability from business intent to production**

I work closely with:
- Technical Product Owners
- Solution Architects
- Data Engineering teams
- AI Engineering teams
- External vendors
- Enterprise stakeholders

## 🧭 Delivery Philosophy

✔ Architecture before implementation  
✔ GitHub as the single source of truth  
✔ Small, reviewable units of work  
✔ No self-approval, no hidden work  
✔ Automation where it helps, discipline where it matters  

> **Initiative → Design → Execution → Review → Production**

## 🛠 Technology Stack & Focus Areas

### ☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** CloudFormation, AWS SAM, Terraform

### 🤖 AI & Generative AI
- Amazon Bedrock (foundation models, inference, and orchestration)
- Amazon Agent Core Runtime:
  - Agent execution and lifecycle management
  - Tool invocation and action orchestration
- Agent governance:
  - Policies, guardrails, and capability control
  - Deterministic fallbacks and escalation strategies
- Agent evaluation & quality control:
  - LLM evaluations and scoring strategies
  - Prompt and response validation
  - LLM-as-a-Judge patterns
- MCP (Model Context Protocol):
  - Standardized tool exposure
  - Secure, observable system integrations
- Observability for GenAI systems:
  - End-to-end tracing of agent interactions
  - Token usage monitoring and optimization
  - Auditability and execution visibility

### 📊 Data Platforms
- Data lake and data warehouse architectures on AWS
- Data ingestion and integration patterns (batch and streaming)
- ETL and ELT processes using AWS Glue (jobs, crawlers, data catalog)
- Event-driven data architectures
- Streaming and near-real-time data processing
- Analytics and query engines using Amazon Athena
- Data quality, governance, and schema management
- Secure data access and cross-account data sharing

### 🔁 Delivery & Tooling
- GitHub Projects & Repositories
- Agile / PI Planning
- Kanban & Flow-based delivery
